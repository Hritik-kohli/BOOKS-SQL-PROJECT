Sales and Customer Insights Using Relational SQL on Bookstore Data

Summary:
Designed and implemented a relational data model using three interlinked datasets—Books, Customers, and Orders—to analyze sales performance, customer behavior, and inventory efficiency. Established primary and foreign key relationships to ensure referential integrity and enable advanced querying across datasets. Delivered actionable business insights through optimized SQL queries, highlighting top-selling books, customer lifetime value, regional sales performance, and inventory status.

Technologies Used:

SQL (MySQL/PostgreSQL)

Relational Database Design (Normalization, Primary/Foreign Keys)

Data Analysis & Reporting

Excel (for CSV exploration)


Project Objective
Create a robust relational schema using normalized tables for Books, Customers, and Orders.

Apply Primary Keys to uniquely identify records in each table.

Use Foreign Keys to define relationships between Orders and both Books and Customers.

Generate 10 real-world SQL queries to simulate interview-level analytics tasks (e.g., Deloitte-style case queries).

Provide insights into:

Best-selling books

High-value customers

Revenue by year and geography

Stock and inventory valuation

Customer segmentation and order behavior
